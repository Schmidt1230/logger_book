# LoggerBook

Cross-platform application for Employers to and Employees to manage their shifts. And also display the amount made by each employee depending on the rate they are employed by. I am also aiming to add media management where employees can upload certain images or videos during their shift which they think is important and relevant for their supervisor to see. 

## Goal
The goal of this project is for me to learn cross-platform application development a bit better and understand core industry concepts such as API requests. 

## Technologies used:

- Front-end: Flutter 
- Back-end: NodeJS
- Database: MongoDB
